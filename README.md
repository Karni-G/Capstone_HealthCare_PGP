## **Project Overview: Predicting Diabetes Using Machine Learning**

As part of my **Caltech Post Graduate Program in Data Science** via Simplilearn, I undertook a healthcare-focused project. The goal was to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements from original health data provided by the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)**.

Here are the key steps I followed during the project:

1. **Data Exploration**: I thoroughly explored the dataset to understand its structure, features, and potential patterns.
2. **Model Building**: Leveraging essential machine learning techniques, I developed and tested predictive models.
3. **Comparison**: I assessed the performance of these models using relevant evaluation metrics.
4. **Reporting**: For visualization and reporting, I utilized **Tableau**.

The project aimed to enhance our understanding of Data Science and Machine learning concepts while preparing us for real-world challenges.
